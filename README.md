# Movie-recommendations-system-

A simple Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on user preferences. This project uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to recommend movies. Built with Python, it leverages popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and possibly a machine learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch if deep learning models are applied.
